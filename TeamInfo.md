## Project Summary

The United States boasts one of the largest freight railroad networks globally. According to the American Association of Railroads (AAR), freight railroads transport approximately 1.6 billion tons of raw materials and finished goods annually.

Beyond moving vast amounts of cargo, the railroad network also generates a wealth of data. The AAR and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) compile and publish several valuable datasets on their websites. For instance, the FRA releases data on railroad equipment accidents, encompassing all types of incidents across the US rail network where total monetary damages exceed a certain threshold. Additionally, traffic data for each railroad company is accessible for download from the FRA website. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) and AAR also provide publicly available data on railroad companies' operational details, including economic factors and shipment information.

The primary objective of this project is to integrate these publicly available datasets into an exhaustive database. This will enable users to examine railroad safety through various accident characteristics across the entire US network and by individual railroad companies, analyze railroad economic and operational factors, and compare safety or operational performance with different railroad companies. The main beneficiaries of our application include the railroad companies themselves, consumers requiring product shipment via rail, and researchers focused on railway safety and operations.
